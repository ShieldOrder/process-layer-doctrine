# ZCG Process Legibility Baseline v0.1

Derived from the Process Layer Doctrine (PLD)
1. System Boundary and Roles

This section describes the institutional boundaries within which Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) operates today, and the roles different actors play across the lifecycle of grant decisions and execution.

It is descriptive, not evaluative.

1.1 What ZCG Is Chartered to Do

ZCG is chartered to:

Solicit and review grant proposals aligned with Zcash ecosystem goals.

Make funding decisions within the scope and authority delegated to it.

Authorize disbursement of funds according to approved proposals and stated conditions.

Monitor grant progress through reporting and check-ins as defined by the committee.

Decide on continuation, modification, or termination of funding within its mandate.

These activities are exercised collectively by the committee under publicly visible processes and documented decisions.

1.2 What ZCG Is Explicitly Not

ZCG is not chartered to:

Define protocol consensus rules or network upgrades.

Override ZIPs, governance charters, or higher-level authority structures.

Operate as a custodial entity for funds beyond its delegated interface.

Enforce outcomes beyond the conditions attached to grant agreements.

Act as a regulator, auditor, or guarantor of grantee success.

ZCG’s role ends at decision-making, authorization, and bounded oversight, not control of implementation outcomes.

1.3 Committee Role Versus Community Role

The committee:

Exercises discretion in proposal evaluation and prioritization.

Interprets alignment within its mandate and available information.

Applies judgment where verification is incomplete or impractical.

The broader community:

Proposes work and ideas.

Observes, critiques, and discusses decisions in public forums.

Provides social accountability through visibility and discourse rather than enforcement power.

These roles are intentionally distinct. Community input informs but does not substitute for committee discretion.

1.4 Separation of Governance, Execution, and Custody

ZCG operates within a layered structure:

Governance: The rules, charters, ZIPs, and processes that define authority and constraints.

Execution: The activities performed by grantees to deliver approved work.

Custody: The entities and mechanisms responsible for holding and disbursing funds.

ZCG sits at the intersection of governance and execution authorization.
It does not directly execute funded work and does not directly custody funds.

This separation is intentional. It reduces concentration of power, limits single-point responsibility, and preserves flexibility across institutional changes.

1.5 Boundary Implications

Because these boundaries exist:

Some decisions necessarily rely on discretion rather than verification.

Some risks are managed socially rather than technically.

Some outcomes cannot be guaranteed, only evaluated and monitored.

These are not defects. They are properties of the system as designed.
