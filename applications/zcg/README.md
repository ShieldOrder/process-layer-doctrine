# PLD Application: Zcash Community Grants

## Purpose

This directory contains descriptive applications of the Process Layer Doctrine (PLD) to the Zcash Community Grants program.

These documents do not propose reforms, mandates, or enforcement.  
They exist to make the current ZCG process legible, inspectable, and comparable over time.

## Scope

The ZCG application focuses on:
- Boundary clarity between applicants, reviewers, committee members, and custodians
- End-to-end decision flow from proposal intake to fund disbursement
- Explicit separation between discretion and verification
- Identification of process ambiguity and risk surfaces

The application does not evaluate individual people or outcomes.  
It evaluates interfaces and artifacts.

## Non-Authority Statement

These documents:
- Do not represent ZCG, FPF, or any committee member
- Do not claim endorsement or institutional standing
- Do not prescribe how ZCG should operate
- Do not assert compliance requirements

They are independent, descriptive mappings derived from the PLD framework.

## Intended Use

These materials may be used by:
- Applicants seeking clearer proposal framing
- Reviewers seeking legible evaluation structure
- Observers analyzing process coherence
- Future committees comparing continuity across terms

Use is opt-in.  
No coordination or permission is required.

## Document Index

01-System-Boundary-and-Roles.md  
Describes role separation and authority boundaries within ZCG.

02-End-to-End-Decision-Flow.md  
Maps proposal movement from submission through evaluation and funding.

03-Discretion-vs-Verification-Map.md  
Identifies where human judgment is exercised versus where verification is possible.

ZCG-Process-Legibility-Baseline-v0.1.md  
A consolidated snapshot of current process legibility derived from the above mappings.

## Relationship to PLD

PLD doctrine is defined in doctrine/PLD.md.  
This directory contains descriptive applications only.

If an application conflicts with the PLD framework, the conflict should be made explicit rather than resolved implicitly.

## Status

Descriptive baseline.  
No prescriptions.  
Subject to revision as public artifacts change.
