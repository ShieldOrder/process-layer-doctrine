# ZCG Process Legibility Baseline v0.1
# Derived from the Process Layer Doctrine (PLD)

## Purpose

This section describes the primary roles involved in the Zcash Community Grants process and the boundaries between governance, execution, custody, and verification.

The objective is to make responsibility, discretion, and authority surfaces explicit so that process behavior can be understood without relying on informal knowledge.

## Role Categories

For legibility, roles are grouped by function rather than by individual or title.

The categories below describe typical functions as they operate in practice. They do not evaluate performance or intent.

## Applicants

Applicants are individuals or teams submitting proposals for funding.

Typical characteristics:
- Define scope, milestones, and requested funding
- Provide narrative, technical, and budget information
- Respond to clarification requests during evaluation
- Execute approved work after funding

Applicants do not control funding decisions or fund custody.

## Reviewers and Committee Members

Reviewers and committee members are responsible for proposal evaluation and funding decisions.

Typical characteristics:
- Assess proposals using judgment and available information
- Request clarification or revisions from applicants
- Deliberate and vote according to the active governance mechanism
- Approve, reject, or defer proposals

Reviewer judgment is discretionary by design.
Evaluation artifacts may or may not be standardized depending on the cycle.

## Governance Mechanism

The governance mechanism defines how authority is exercised.

In ZCG, this typically includes:
- Committee based discretion
- Defined voting or approval thresholds
- Term limits and periodic turnover

The governance mechanism determines who decides, not how decisions are documented or verified.

## Custodian and Fund Administrator

Custodians and fund administrators are responsible for holding and disbursing funds.

Typical characteristics:
- Hold funds on behalf of the program
- Execute disbursements after approval
- Apply operational or legal constraints as required
- Do not evaluate proposal merit

Custody is operational, not discretionary with respect to proposal selection.

## Verification and Oversight Functions

Verification functions check whether approved work has been delivered as specified.

In practice, verification may be performed by:
- Committee members
- Designated reviewers
- External parties
- Public observers through artifact review

Verification rigor varies and may rely on:
- Milestone reports
- Public repositories
- Deliverable artifacts
- Attestations

Verification is often partially implicit.

## Boundary Observations

Key boundaries in the ZCG process include:
- Applicants do not decide funding outcomes
- Reviewers do not custody funds
- Custodians do not evaluate merit
- Verification roles may overlap with reviewers unless explicitly separated

When roles overlap, the overlap is typically informal rather than formally declared.

## PLD Interpretation

From a PLD perspective:
- Boundary clarity reduces ambiguity and hindsight reinterpretation
- Overlapping roles are not prohibited but should be visible
- Undeclared coupling between decision, execution, and verification increases process risk

This section does not recommend changes.
It establishes a shared map of role boundaries as they are commonly understood.

## Status

Descriptive baseline.
No prescriptions.
No authority claims.
