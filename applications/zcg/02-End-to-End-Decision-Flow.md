## Purpose

This section describes, at a high level, how Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) decisions and grant execution typically flow in practice.

The intent is descriptive only.  
No stage is evaluated, optimized, or judged.

The flow represents a composite derived from documented process, public discussion, and observed practice across multiple grant cycles.

## 2.1 Proposal Intake

Grant proposals are submitted by applicants through publicly visible channels defined by ZCG at the time of submission.

Typical characteristics:
- Proposals are applicant-authored and self-scoped
- Content format varies by applicant maturity and grant type
- Initial completeness and clarity vary widely

At this stage:
- No verification is performed
- No commitments are implied
- Ambiguity is common and expected

## 2.2 Evaluation and Review

Committee members review submitted proposals individually and collectively.

Observed elements include:
- Independent reading and assessment by committee members
- Informal clarification requests directed to applicants
- Reference to prior grants, ecosystem context, or stated ZCG priorities

Evaluation inputs may include:
- Applicant claims
- Prior work or reputation
- Public
