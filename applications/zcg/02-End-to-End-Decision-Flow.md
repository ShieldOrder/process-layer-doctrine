# Derived from the Process Layer Doctrine (PLD)

## Purpose

This section describes, at a high level, how Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) decisions and grant execution typically flow in practice today.

The intent is descriptive only.
No stage is evaluated, optimized, or judged.

The flow represents a composite derived from documented process, public discussion, and observed practice across multiple grant cycles.

## 2.1 Proposal Intake

Grant proposals are submitted by applicants through publicly visible channels defined by ZCG at the time of submission.

Typical characteristics:
- Proposals are applicant authored and self scoped
- Content format varies by applicant maturity and grant type
- Initial completeness and clarity vary widely

At this stage:
- No verification is performed
- No commitments are implied
- Ambiguity is common and expected

## 2.2 Evaluation and Review

Committee members review submitted proposals individually and collectively.

Observed elements include:
- Independent reading and assessment by committee members
- Informal clarification requests directed to applicants
- Reference to prior grants, ecosystem context, or stated ZCG priorities

Evaluation inputs may include:
- Applicant claims
- Prior work or reputation
- Public discussion threads
- Committee judgment

The structure and depth of review are not uniform across proposals.

## 2.3 Deliberation

Following review, committee members deliberate to form a decision.

Deliberation typically occurs:
- Internally among committee members
- With varying degrees of explicit reasoning recorded publicly

At this stage:
- Tradeoffs are weighed
- Uncertainty is resolved through discussion
- Judgment plays a central role

Deliberation outcomes may include approval, rejection, or conditional approval.

## 2.4 Approval and Conditions

Approved proposals may include explicit or implicit conditions.

These conditions can relate to:
- Scope clarification
- Milestone definition
- Reporting expectations
- Payment structure

Conditions are typically:
- Communicated directly to the applicant
- Reflected in grant agreements or public summaries

The specificity of conditions varies by proposal and committee judgment.

## 2.5 Disbursement Mechanics

Once approved, grant funds are disbursed according to the agreed structure.

Observed characteristics:
- Disbursement may be lump sum or milestone based
- Timing is influenced by operational and custodial processes
- ZCG interfaces with custodial entities for fund movement

Committee involvement at this stage is bounded by role and charter.

## 2.6 Ongoing Monitoring and Reporting

During grant execution:
- Some grants provide periodic updates
- Others report only at milestones or completion
- Reporting formats and depth are not uniform

Monitoring is largely:
- Read only
- Based on applicant provided information
- Contextualized by committee judgment

## 2.7 Completion, Renewal, or Termination

At the conclusion of a grant:
- Work may be considered complete
- A renewal may be proposed
- Or the grant relationship may end

Completion assessment may consider:
- Delivered outputs
- Alignment with original intent
- Ecosystem impact as perceived

Formal closure mechanisms vary.

## 2.8 Flow Summary

Across all stages:
- Discretion and judgment are central
- Verification exists unevenly
- Trust assumptions are present but often implicit

These characteristics are explored further in subsequent sections.

## Status

Descriptive baseline.
No prescriptions.
No authority claims.
