# Baseline Notice

Files in this directory labeled as part of the ZCG Process Legibility Baseline are historical descriptive snapshots.

They are not updated in place.

Changes that affect descriptive claims require:
- a new versioned baseline file, or
- a new release with an explicit changelog entry

This preserves continuity and prevents retrospective reinterpretation.
