03. Discretion vs Verification Map
Purpose

This section maps where discretion is exercised and where verification exists across the ZCG decision and execution flow described in Section 2.

The goal is not to evaluate whether discretion is appropriate or whether verification is sufficient, but to make visible:

where human judgment is structurally required

where objective checks are available

where trust assumptions are implicit

where ambiguity is a deliberate design choice versus an incidental one

This section is observational only.

Method

For each stage of the end-to-end flow, we identify:

Discretion surface
Areas where outcomes depend on human judgment, interpretation, or contextual assessment.

Verification surface
Areas where outcomes can be checked against objective artifacts, records, or observable facts.

Implicit trust assumptions
Expectations placed on actors or processes that are not formally verified.

Ambiguity type
Whether ambiguity is structural (by design) or incidental (by implementation or documentation).

Stage-by-Stage Map
1. Proposal Intake

Discretion

Determining whether a submission is “in scope”

Interpreting intent when proposals do not fit templates cleanly

Handling incomplete or unconventional submissions

Verification

Presence of required fields or materials

Timestamped submission records

Public availability of proposal text

Implicit Trust

Applicants accurately represent their intentions

Submitted materials reflect actual planned work

Ambiguity

Structural: scope boundaries are intentionally broad

Incidental: variance in proposal clarity and formatting

2. Evaluation and Review

Discretion

Assessing merit, relevance, and potential impact

Weighting tradeoffs between competing priorities

Interpreting feasibility and risk narratives

Verification

Public discussion threads

Referenced prior work, code, or deployments

Historical performance where applicable

Implicit Trust

Reviewers apply criteria consistently

Claims made by applicants are materially accurate

Ambiguity

Structural: qualitative assessment is unavoidable

Incidental: uneven depth of reviewer commentary

3. Deliberation

Discretion

Internal judgment calls during committee discussion

Resolution of disagreement among reviewers

Final synthesis of divergent views

Verification

Recorded votes or decisions where published

Public statements summarizing outcomes

Implicit Trust

Deliberation reflects good-faith reasoning

Internal discussions are conducted responsibly

Ambiguity

Structural: deliberation is not fully observable

Structural: confidentiality may be required

4. Approval and Conditions

Discretion

Deciding whether to approve, reject, or request changes

Defining conditional milestones or reporting expectations

Interpreting what constitutes acceptable progress

Verification

Published approval decisions

Documented conditions or milestones

Funding amounts and schedules

Implicit Trust

Conditions are framed clearly and interpreted consistently

Applicants understand expectations as intended

Ambiguity

Structural: conditions are context-dependent

Incidental: variable specificity in condition wording

5. Disbursement Mechanics

Discretion

Timing decisions when dependencies or delays arise

Handling edge cases or exceptional circumstances

Verification

On-chain transactions

Public disbursement records

Custodial attestations where applicable

Implicit Trust

Custodial entities execute transfers correctly

Funds reach intended recipients

Ambiguity

Structural: custody is external to committee control

Incidental: visibility varies by custodian

6. Ongoing Monitoring and Reporting

Discretion

Assessing whether reported progress is satisfactory

Deciding when intervention or follow-up is necessary

Verification

Progress reports

Public updates, code commits, or delivered artifacts

Community feedback

Implicit Trust

Reports are truthful and complete

Absence of reports does not imply misconduct

Ambiguity

Structural: not all work is externally verifiable

Incidental: inconsistent reporting cadence

7. Completion, Renewal, or Termination

Discretion

Determining whether objectives have been met

Evaluating renewal requests

Deciding when termination is appropriate

Verification

Delivered outputs

Final reports

Historical record of execution

Implicit Trust

Delivered artifacts correspond to funded scope

Past performance is weighed appropriately

Ambiguity

Structural: success criteria are context-sensitive

Structural: long-term impact may be unknowable at decision time

Observational Summary

Across the ZCG process:

Discretion is concentrated in evaluation, deliberation, and interpretation of progress.

Verification is strongest at intake, disbursement, and artifact delivery.

Trust assumptions are unavoidable where privacy, autonomy, or qualitative judgment are involved.

Most ambiguity is structural, reflecting deliberate design choices rather than process failure.

No conclusions are drawn here regarding optimization or reform. This map exists solely to make the current landscape legible.
