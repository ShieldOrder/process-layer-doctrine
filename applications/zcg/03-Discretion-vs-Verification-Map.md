# 03-Discretion-vs-Verification-Map
# ZCG Process Legibility Baseline v0.1
# Derived from the Process Layer Doctrine (PLD)

## Purpose

This section maps where discretion and verification appear across the Zcash Community Grants process, and where implicit trust assumptions are commonly relied upon.

The intent is to make these surfaces visible, not to evaluate their adequacy or recommend changes.

## Conceptual Distinction

For the purposes of this document:

Discretion refers to decisions made through human judgment where outcomes cannot be fully specified or verified in advance.

Verification refers to the ability to confirm whether a stated condition or outcome has been met using observable evidence.

Both are necessary.
PLD does not seek to eliminate discretion.
It seeks to make the boundary between discretion and verification explicit.

## Discretion Dominant Surfaces

The following stages rely primarily on human judgment:

- Proposal merit assessment
- Assessment of ecosystem relevance
- Weighing of tradeoffs between competing proposals
- Interpretation of ambiguous or underspecified claims
- Decisions under uncertainty or incomplete information

At these surfaces:
- Reasoning may be implicit
- Outcomes may not be reproducible
- Different reviewers may reach different conclusions

This discretion is intentional and inherent to the governance model.

## Verification Dominant Surfaces

The following stages are amenable to verification:

- Confirmation that milestones were delivered
- Validation of publicly observable artifacts
- Checking scope conformance against approved terms
- Verification of timelines and deliverable existence

Verification typically relies on:
- Repositories or published outputs
- Milestone reports
- Demonstrable functionality or documentation
- Third party inspection

Verification quality varies based on how milestones are specified.

## Mixed Surfaces

Several stages combine discretion and verification:

- Milestone definition at approval time
- Assessment of partial completion
- Evaluation of impact claims after delivery

In these cases:
- Verification may confirm outputs
- Discretion may be required to interpret significance or sufficiency

The boundary between the two is often informal.

## Implicit Trust Assumptions

Across the process, trust is commonly assumed in areas such as:
- Accuracy of applicant self reporting
- Good faith execution after funding
- Completeness of provided updates
- Alignment between stated and actual scope

These assumptions are rarely documented explicitly.

## PLD Interpretation

From a PLD perspective:
- Discretion should be named and owned
- Verification should be specified where feasible
- Implicit trust should be made visible when it substitutes for verification

This document does not prescribe where discretion should be reduced or verification increased.

## Status

Descriptive baseline.
No prescriptions.
No authority claims.
