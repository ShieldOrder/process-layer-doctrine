# ZCG Process Legibility Baseline v0.1

Derived from the Process Layer Doctrine (PLD)

## 0. Preamble and Scope

### Purpose
This document is a descriptive baseline of how Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) decisions and grant execution typically flow in practice, and where discretion, verification, and implicit trust assumptions tend to appear along that flow.

It is written for:
- future committee members onboarding into an existing process
- applicants who want to understand what “done” means operationally
- observers who want a legible map of decision and execution surfaces

### What this is
- A mapping of the end-to-end decision and execution flow as implemented
- A separation of surfaces: governance mechanism, process execution, and custody interfaces
- A structured inventory of where signals are objective vs judgment-based
- A continuity artifact intended to reduce institutional memory loss across committee turnover

### What this is not
- Not a governance proposal
- Not a mandate
- Not a scoring system
- Not an evaluation of people, motives, or past decisions
- Not a security audit or a claim of defects

### Relationship to PLD
PLD is an execution-hygiene framework that treats process as infrastructure. This baseline applies the PLD lens descriptively by:
- decomposing the workflow into stages
- separating discretion from verification at each stage
- making implicit assumptions explicit without prescribing changes

PLD’s five tests (Impact, Clarity, Alignment, Deliverability, Verification) are used later as an observational overlay only.

### Neutrality and non-prescriptive stance
This baseline is mechanism-neutral. It is intended to remain useful under:
- committee-based discretion
- ZCAP-style processes
- hybrid or future governance mechanisms

The goal is legibility, not redesign.

### Versioning and change control
- v0.1 is intentionally limited to descriptive mapping.
- Any future versions that include recommendations must be clearly labeled as non-binding and separated from the descriptive baseline.
