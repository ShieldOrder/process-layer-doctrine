# ZCG Process Legibility Baseline v0.1
# Derived from the Process Layer Doctrine (PLD)

## Purpose

This document describes how Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) decisions and grant execution typically operate in practice, and where discretion, verification, and implicit trust assumptions appear along that flow.

It exists to support continuity and legibility for future committee members, applicants seeking operational clarity, and observers who require a concrete map of decision and execution surfaces.

## What This Is

This document provides a descriptive mapping of the end to end ZCG decision and execution process as it currently exists.

It separates governance mechanisms, process execution, and custody interfaces, and identifies where signals are:
- objective
- judgment based
- implicit or trust assumed

It is intended as a continuity artifact to reduce institutional memory loss across committee turnover.

## What This Is Not

This document is not:
- a governance proposal
- a mandate or reform plan
- a scoring or ranking system
- an evaluation of individuals, intent, or outcomes
- a security or financial audit

It does not assert the presence of defects or failures.

## Relationship to the Process Layer Doctrine

The Process Layer Doctrine defines execution hygiene for governance systems by treating process as infrastructure.

This baseline applies the PLD lens descriptively by:
- decomposing the ZCG workflow into discrete stages
- separating discretion from verification at each stage
- making implicit assumptions visible without prescribing change

The PLD five tests (Impact, Clarity, Alignment, Deliverability, Verification) are referenced later strictly as an observational overlay, not as an evaluative framework.

## Neutrality and Non Prescriptive Stance

This document is mechanism neutral.

It is intended to remain applicable under:
- committee based discretion
- ZCAP style governance
- hybrid or future governance mechanisms

Its objective is legibility, not redesign.

## Versioning and Change Control

Version 0.1 is intentionally limited to descriptive mapping.

Any future versions that introduce recommendations must:
- be explicitly labeled as non binding
- be maintained separately from the baseline
- not retroactively alter this document’s descriptive claims
