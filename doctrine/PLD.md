# Process Layer Doctrine

## Canonical Statement

The Process Layer Doctrine defines a neutral process layer that sits between governance intent and execution outcomes.

It does not decide what should be funded or governed.
It defines how decisions are made legible, verifiable, and inspectable.

PLD treats process as infrastructure.

## Scope

PLD applies to systems where:
- Funds, authority, or resources are allocated
- Multiple actors interact across time
- Decisions must survive institutional turnover
- Accountability depends on artifacts rather than trust

PLD does not assume good faith or bad faith.
It assumes complexity.

## Core Invariants

PLD enforces the following invariants:

1. Boundary Clarity  
Roles, authority, and custody must be explicitly separated.
No actor may evaluate, execute, and verify the same work without disclosure.

2. End to End Legibility  
A decision must be traceable from intake to resolution using observable artifacts.
Missing steps are treated as risk, not as discretion.

3. Discretion Is Explicit  
Human judgment is allowed only where verification is impossible or inefficient.
Discretion must be named, bounded, and owned.

4. Verification Is Preferred  
Where verification is possible, it is always favored over narrative justification.
Verification requires artifacts, not assurances.

5. Continuity Over Individuals  
Processes must remain intelligible after the departure of any single participant.
Knowledge that only lives in people is considered fragile.

## Artifact Discipline

PLD treats artifacts as first class objects.

Artifacts include:
- Proposals
- Milestone definitions
- Evaluation memos
- Disclosure statements
- Verification outputs

Verbal context does not substitute for artifacts.
Artifacts may reference discussion, but discussion may not replace artifacts.

## Separation of Layers

PLD distinguishes between three layers:

Governance  
Sets intent and constraints.

Execution  
Delivers work under agreed terms.

Custody and Verification  
Holds funds and verifies outcomes.

PLD does not collapse these layers.
It documents their interfaces.

## Neutrality and Non Authority

PLD claims no authority.
It confers no legitimacy.
It enforces no outcomes.

Its function is to reduce ambiguity so that authority can be exercised with clearer sightlines.

## Failure Modes Addressed

PLD is designed to surface, not eliminate:
- Ambiguous milestones
- Role confusion
- Narrative substitution for evidence
- Silent scope expansion
- Process drift over time

## Canonical Rule

Normative definitions live only in this document.
All applications are descriptive mappings.

If an application conflicts with this doctrine, the doctrine prevails.
