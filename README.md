# Process Layer Doctrine

Canonical home for the Process Layer Doctrine (PLD) and its descriptive applications.

## Purpose

PLD defines execution hygiene for governance and funding systems.
It is mechanism neutral, non prescriptive, and portable across institutions.

PLD exists to make decision processes legible, verifiable, and durable under personnel and governance turnover.

## Core Principles

PLD prioritizes:
- Clear system boundaries and role separation
- End to end decision flow visibility
- Explicit distinction between discretion and verification
- Artifact based reasoning over narrative claims
- Continuity independent of elected or appointed actors

## What PLD Is Not

PLD is not:
- A governance mechanism
- A scoring or ranking framework
- An audit or enforcement system
- A source of authority or representation
- A replacement for human judgment

## Repository Structure

doctrine/
Authoritative normative definitions of PLD concepts and tests.
This is the canonical anchor.

applications/
Context specific, descriptive mappings derived from PLD.
No prescriptions or authority claims live here.

references/
Lineage, source material, and historical context.

## Usage Model

PLD is designed to be:
- Read independently of any single ecosystem
- Applied descriptively before prescriptively
- Used to surface ambiguity, not to resolve it by fiat

Institutions, reviewers, and applicants may adopt or reference PLD artifacts without coordination or permission.

## Status

Canonical doctrine and descriptive applications.
No prescriptions in v0.1.
