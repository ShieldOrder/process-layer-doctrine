# Process Layer Doctrine

Reference home for the Process Layer Doctrine (PLD) and its descriptive applications.

## Purpose

PLD defines a set of execution hygiene principles for governance and funding systems. It is mechanism neutral, non-prescriptive, and portable across institutions.

PLD exists to make decision processes legible, verifiable, and durable under personnel and governance turnover.

This framework provides reference definitions and process distinctions as used within PLD. It does not claim consensus, endorsement, or authority beyond its own internal coherence.

## Core Principles

PLD prioritizes:

- Clear system boundaries and role separation
- End-to-end decision flow visibility
- Explicit distinction between discretion and verification
- Artifact-based reasoning over narrative claims
- Continuity independent of elected or appointed actors

## What PLD Is Not

PLD is not:

- A governance mechanism
- A scoring or ranking framework
- An audit or enforcement system
- A source of authority or representation
- A replacement for human judgment

## Repository Structure

- doctrine/
  - Reference definitions and core concepts used within the PLD framework. These definitions are internal to this framework and are not mandates.

- applications/
  - Context-specific, descriptive mappings derived from PLD concepts. These materials illustrate possible applications and do not carry prescriptive or authoritative force.

- references/
  - Lineage, source material, and historical context informing the framework.

## Usage Model

PLD is designed to be:

- Read independently of any single ecosystem
- Applied descriptively before prescriptively
- Used to surface ambiguity rather than resolve it by fiat

Institutions, reviewers, and applicants may adopt or reference PLD artifacts without coordination, permission, or endorsement.

## Scope and Evolution

This framework is intentionally non-authoritative and non-binding. Governance processes are expected to evolve across communities and over time. The distinctions and definitions here are descriptive tools, not mandates, and may be adapted, ignored, or replaced without invalidating the framework's internal logic.

## Status
