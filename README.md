# Process Layer Doctrine

Canonical home for the Process Layer Doctrine (PLD) and its descriptive applications.

## What This Is
The Process Layer Doctrine defines execution hygiene for governance systems.
It is mechanism-neutral and non-prescriptive.

It focuses on:
- Legibility of decision flow
- Separation between governance, execution, and custody
- Verifiability over narrative
- Continuity across institutional turnover

## What This Is Not
- Not a governance mechanism
- Not an audit framework
- Not an enforcement system
- Not a scoring or ranking tool

## Structure
- `doctrine/` — Core PLD concepts and tests
- `applications/` — Descriptive baselines derived from PLD
- `references/` — Source material and lineage

## Status
Canonical. Descriptive-first. No prescriptions in v0.1.
